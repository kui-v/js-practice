1. Select elements
    access elements using jQuery's CSS-style selectors rather than DOM queries
2. Perofrm tasks
    update DOM tree, animate elements, loop through set of elements easily
3. Handle events
    attach event listeners to selected elements without
    having to write any fallback code to support older browsers

jQuery = JS file included in web page

find elements using CSS-style selectors
    $('<tag>.<attribute>') or jQuery('<tag>.<attribute>')

do stuff with those elements using jQuery methods
    $('<tag>.<attribute>).<method>;
    ex: $('li.hot').addClass('complete');

Difference from DOM
    cross-browser; compatible
    element selection easier and more accurate
    event handling simpler
    methods affect all selected elements w/o need to loop
    additional methods provided for populat tasks, s.a. animation
    once made selection, apply multiple methods to it
